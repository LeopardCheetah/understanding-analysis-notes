# Understanding Analysis Solutions

Solutions for Abbott's classic textbook on Real Analysis, *Understanding Analysis (2nd ed.)*. Was convinced by [Uli](https://uli.rocks/p/study-puremath/) to publish my solutions so here they are.

`sols.pdf` (or whatever the file is called) should have the most up to date generated `.pdf` file. The raw tex is found at the corresponding `.tex` file. (Note: this will most likely become a mono-file repo or something and the `.tex` file will have a billion lines but that's just how I roll :/).
